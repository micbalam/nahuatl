<h1>Translate Nahuatl to Spanish or English.</h1>
<hr>
<p>The language Nahuatl it is spoken by more than 1.5 million people. It is recognized as a national language, the natural mother tongue of the Mexican people, but there are no translators for this language.</p>
<p>I checked on Google Translator to find help to translate some words to Nahuatl but there is no information about this language. </P>
<p>I made some search to look for translators and I found a great site that is trying to create this translator with one program called Grammatical Framework, <a href="http://www.speechlike.org/2013/03/nahuatl-morphology-revisited/">Speechlike</a> and he share the files in this repository <a href="https://github.com/nmashton/nahuatl#classical-nahuatl-grammar">Classical Nahuatl grammar</a>. I am not an expert in coding, programming or even the GF code. I guess this is out of my scope for the moment.</p>
<p>I want to find a better and faster option to translate, introduce and learn about the language Nahuatl. This project will be a challenge to me to also learn the language. I will try to set up the dictionary or files to translate from Google Translator because of their popularity.</p>

<h2>Project status</p>
<p>Search for all the documents and possibilities to add a new Translation language in Google.</p>
